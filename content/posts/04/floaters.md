## What are floaters? Why?

- Patients complain of seeing black dots, rings, strands, 'spider-like' images that are more 
noticable against a bright background and 'move' even when the eye is stationary. 
<br><br>
- The normally transparent vitreous gel liquefies and breaks up, leading to the presence of little
particles and fibrous stands floating in the vitreous cavity. <br><br> 
- The debris casts shadow onto the retina  

## Benign floaters

- Indicate some form of vitreous degeneration and liquefaction
- Usually benign and age-related
- Common at a younger age in myopes

## Dangerous floaters

- Shower of dots
- A sudden increase in their numbers could indicate the formation of a **retinal tear**, especially 
if associated with **photopsia** (flashes)
- The onset of new floaters in patients with [**diabetic retinopathy**](https://eyewiki.aao.org/Diabetic_Retinopathy "Eye Wiki")  is dangerous and could indicate **vitreous haemorrhage**

## Differential diagnosis - floaters

### Transient
- Migraine

### Persistent
*More common*
- Vitreous synergies, PVD, vitreous haemorrhage, intermediate or posterior uveitis

*Less common*
- Hyphema/microphema, retinal break or detachment, corneal opacity, or foreign body

## Photopsia

- A phenomenon in which the patient perceivec flashes of light or has a sensation of flickering lights
- Last less than 1 second is typical flashes associated with retinal origin 

## Cause of photopsia

- Vitreous shrinkage or liquefaction
- Causing a pull on the vitreoretinal attachments
- Irritating the retina and causing it to discharge electrical impulse 
- These impulses are interpreted by the brain as 'flashes'

## Other causes of photopsia

- Ocular migraine
- Vetebrobasilar insufficiency 

## Differential diagnosis - photopsias

*More common*
- Posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), retinal break or detachment, migraine, rapid eye movement (particularly in darkeness), oculodigital stimulation, dysphotopsias from an IOLs
 
*Less common*
- Retinitis/uveitis (e.g white dot syndromes), CNS (particularly occipital love disorders), vestibulobasilar insufficiency, optic neuropathies, entopic phenomena, drug-related, hallucinations, iatrogenic (e.g. after laser photocoagulation)

## What to do

- Indirect ophthalmoscopic examination
- Any peripheral retinal degeneration should be looked for
- Particularly if photopsia is accompanied by floaters
